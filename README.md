## World Map Fast Travel - [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/wasteland3/mods/27)
Adds the ability to travel to locations on the world map by right clicking on them, it will then open the entry location selection and you can choose where to go or cancel.

DISCLAIMER: Fast travel has the potential to miss game trigger and cause game breaking bugs like uncompletable quests, use at your own risk! Especially if you enable travel to undiscovered locations.
